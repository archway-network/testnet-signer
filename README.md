# Testnet signer utility

This utility generates a signed JSON-formatted ID to prove ownership of a key used to submit tx on the blockchain. This testnet signer utility is required for all users who participate in testnet challenges that involve sending tx on the testnet. The challenge submission requires the ID message be signed by the primary key used to deploy the smart contract.

# Installation

Go `1.16` is required.

If you haven't already, download and install Go. See the official [go.dev documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install). Make sure your `GOBIN` and `GOPATH` are set correctly.

## Get the source code and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/archway-network/testnet-signer
cd testnet-signer
make install
```
